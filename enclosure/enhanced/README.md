# Parts List

Here are all the parts you need to build this 3D printed enclosures. It's compatible with the Open Gamma Detector Rev. 2 and 3 and also a lot more handy and smaller than the simple case.

The case is designed to fit a scintillator with a maximum size of 5 x 5 x 5 cm. The USB connection can be accessed through a hole in the front.

You can have a look at all the different designs by uploading them to [ViewSTL](https://www.viewstl.com/).

All of the design work has been done by [@sebyon](https://github.com/sebyon), many thanks!

## Main Body

These are the `Case_Lower.stl` and `Case_Upper.stl` files.

- 10 x M3\*5.7\*4.6 Threaded Heatset Inserts
- 10 x M3\*10mm screws

## Inserts

The plug-in inserts for the display and the panel/buttons are called `LCD_Bezel.stl` and `Panel_Cover.stl` respectively.

These are just friction fits and aren't screwed. The LCD cover is designed for a 1.3 inch OLED display (SH1106). The panel cover can be replaced by a custom made cover that fits your needs, e.g. for buttons.
